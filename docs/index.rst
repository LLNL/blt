BLT
===

**Build, Link and Test**

BLT is composition of CMake macros and several widely used open source tools assembled to simplify HPC software development. 

BLT was released by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) under a BSD-style open source license. 
It is developed on github under LLNL's github organization: https://github.com/llnl/blt

.. note::
  BLT officially supports CMake 3.8 and above.  However we only print a warning if you
  are below our this version.  Some features may or may not work. Use at your own risk.


BLT at a Glance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Simplifies Setup

  * CMake macros for:

    * Creating libraries and executables
    * Managing compiler flags
    * Managing external dependencies

  * Multi-platform support (HPC Platforms, OSX, Windows)

* Batteries included

  * Built-in support for HPC Basics: MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA
  * Built-in support for unit testing in C/C++ and Fortran
  
* Streamlines development processes

  * Support for documentation generation
  * Support for code health tools:

    * Runtime and static analysis, benchmarking

BLT User Tutorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This tutorial is aimed at getting BLT users up and running as quickly as possible.

It provides instructions for:

    * Adding BLT to a CMake project
    * Setting up *host-config* files to handle multiple platform configurations
    * Building, linking, and installing libraries and executables
    * Setting up unit tests with GTest
    * Using external project dependencies
    * Creating documentation with Sphinx and Doxygen

The tutorial provides several examples that calculate the value of :math:`\pi` 
by approximating the integral :math:`f(x) = \int_0^14/(1+x^2)` using numerical
integration. The code is adapted from:
https://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/usingmpi/examples-usingmpi/simplempi/cpi_c.html.

The tutorial requires a C++ compiler and CMake, we recommend using CMake 3.8.0 or newer. Parts of the tutorial also require MPI, CUDA, Sphinx and Doxygen.
