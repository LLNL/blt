BLT: Build, Link, and Test
==========================

BLT is a composition of CMake macros and several widely used open source tools 
assembled to simplify HPC software development. 

BLT was released by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) under a BSD-style open source license. 
It is developed on GitHub under `LLNL's GitHub organization <https://github.com/LLNL/blt>`_.

.. note::
  BLT officially supports CMake 3.8 and above.  However we only print a warning if you
  are below this version.  Some features in earlier versions may or may not work. Use at your own risk.
