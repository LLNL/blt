**Build, Link, and Test**

BLT is a composition of CMake macros and several widely used open source tools 
assembled to simplify HPC software development. 

BLT was released by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) under a BSD-style open source license. 
It is developed on github under LLNL's github organization: https://github.com/llnl/blt

.. note::
  BLT officially supports CMake 3.8 and above.  However we only print a warning if you
