Code Check Macros
==================

blt_add_code_checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: cmake

    blt_add_code_checks( PREFIX              <Base name used for created targets>
                         SOURCES             [source1 [source2 ...]]
                         UNCRUSTIFY_CFG_FILE <Path to Uncrustify config file>
                         ASTYLE_CFG_FILE     <Path to AStyle config file>)

This macro adds all enabled code check targets for the given SOURCES.

PREFIX
  Prefix used for the created code check build targets. For example:
  <PREFIX>_uncrustify_check

SOURCES
  Source list that the code checks will be ran on

UNCRUSTIFY_CFG_FILE
  Path to Uncrustify config file

ASTYLE_CFG_FILE
  Path to AStyle config file

Sources are filtered based on file extensions for use in these code checks.  If you need
additional file extensions defined add them to BLT_C_FILE_EXTS and BLT_Fortran_FILE_EXTS.
Currently this macro only has code checks for C/C++ and simply filters out the Fortran files.

This macro supports code formatting with either Uncrustify or AStyle (but not both at the same time)
only if the following requirements are met:

- Uncrustify

  * UNCRUSTIFY_CFG_FILE is given
  * UNCRUSTIFY_EXECUTABLE is defined and found prior to calling this macro

- AStyle

  * ASTYLE_CFG_FILE is given
  * ASTYLE_EXECUTABLE is defined and found prior to calling this macro

Enabled code formatting checks produce a `check` build target that will test to see if you
are out of compliance with your code formatting and a `style` build target that will actually
modify your source files.  It also creates smaller child build targets that follow the pattern
`<PREFIX>_<uncrustify|astyle>_<check|style>`.

This macro supports the following static analysis tools with their requirements:

- CppCheck

  * CPPCHECK_EXECUTABLE is defined and found prior to calling this macro

- Clang-Query

  * CLANGQUERY_EXECUTABLE is defined and found prior to calling this macro

These are added as children to the `check` build target and produce child build targets
that follow the pattern `<PREFIX>_<cppcheck|clangquery>_check`.

blt_add_clang_query_target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: cmake

    blt_add_clang_query_target( NAME              <Created Target Name>
                                WORKING_DIRECTORY <Working Directory>
                                COMMENT           <Additional Comment for Target Invocation>
                                CHECKERS          <specifies a subset of checkers>
                                DIE_ON_MATCH      <TRUE | FALSE (default)>
                                SRC_FILES         [source1 [source2 ...]])

Creates a new build target for running clang-query.

NAME
  Name of created build target

WORKING_DIRECTORY
  Directory in which the clang-query command is run. Defaults to where macro is called.

COMMENT
  Comment prepended to the build target output

CHECKERS
  list of checkers to be run by created build target

DIE_ON_MATCH
  Causes build failure on first clang-query match. Defaults to FALSE.S

SRC_FILES
  Source list that clang-query will be ran on

Clang-query is a tool used for examining and matching the Clang AST. It is useful for enforcing
coding standards and rules on your source code.  A good primer on how to use clang-query can be
found `here <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/exploring-clang-tooling-part-2-examining-the-clang-ast-with-clang-query/>`_.

Turning on DIE_ON_MATCH is useful if you're using this in CI to enforce rules about your code.

CHECKERS are the static analysis passes to specifically run on the target. The following checker options
can be given:

    * (no value)          : run all available static analysis checks found
    * (checker1:checker2) : run checker1 and checker2
    * (interpreter)       : run the clang-query interpeter to interactively develop queries
