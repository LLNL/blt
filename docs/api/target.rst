Target Macros
=============

.. _blt_add_benchmark:

blt_add_benchmark
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: cmake

    blt_add_benchmark( NAME          [name]
                       COMMAND       [command]
                       NUM_MPI_TASKS [n])

Adds a benchmark to the project.

NAME
  Name that CTest reports.

COMMAND
  Command line that will be used to run the test and can include arguments.  

NUM_MPI_TASKS
  Indicates this is an MPI test and how many MPI tasks to use.

This macro adds a benchmark test to the ``Benchmark`` CTest configuration
which can be run by the ``run_benchmarks`` build target.  These tests are
not run when you use the regular ``test`` build target.

This macro is just a thin wrapper around :ref:`blt_add_test` and assists 
with building up the correct command line for running the benchmark.  For more
information see :ref:`blt_add_test`.

The underlying executable should be previously added to the build system
with :ref:`blt_add_executable`. It should include the necessary benchmarking 
library in its DEPENDS_ON list.

Any calls to this macro should be guarded with ENABLE_BENCHMARKS unless this option
is always on in your build project.

.. note::
  BLT provides a built-in Google Benchmark that is enabled by default if you set
  ENABLE_BENCHMARKS=ON and can be turned off with the option ENABLE_GBENCHMARK.

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: **Example**
    :linenos:

    if(ENABLE_BENCHMARKS)
        blt_add_executable(NAME    component_benchmark
                           SOURCES my_benchmark.cpp
                           DEPENDS gbenchmark)
        blt_add_benchmark(
             NAME    component_benchmark
             COMMAND component_benchmark "--benchmark_min_time=0.0 --v=3 --benchmark_format=json")
    endif()

.. _blt_add_executable:

blt_add_executable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: cmake

    blt_add_executable( NAME       <name>
                        SOURCES    [source1 [source2 ...]]
                        INCLUDES   [dir1 [dir2 ...]]
                        DEFINES    [define1 [define2 ...]]
                        DEPENDS_ON [dep1 [dep2 ...]]
                        OUTPUT_DIR [dir]
                        FOLDER     [name])

Adds an executable target, called <name>, to be built from the given sources.

The INCLUDES argument allows you to define what include directories are
needed to compile this executable.

The DEFINES argument allows you to add needed compiler definitions that are
needed to compile this executable.

If given a DEPENDS_ON argument, it will add the necessary includes and 
libraries if they are already registered with blt_register_library.  If
not it will add them as a cmake target dependency.

The OUTPUT_DIR is used to control the build output directory of this 
executable. This is used to overwrite the default bin directory.

If the first entry in SOURCES is a Fortran source file, the fortran linker 
is used. (via setting the CMake target property LINKER_LANGUAGE to Fortran )
FOLDER is an optional keyword to organize the target into a folder in an IDE.

This is available when ENABLE_FOLDERS is ON and when using a cmake generator
that supports this feature and will otherwise be ignored.


.. _blt_add_library:

blt_add_library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: cmake

    blt_add_library( NAME         <libname>
                     SOURCES      [source1 [source2 ...]]
                     HEADERS      [header1 [header2 ...]]
                     INCLUDES     [dir1 [dir2 ...]]
                     DEFINES      [define1 [define2 ...]]
                     DEPENDS_ON   [dep1 ...] 
                     OUTPUT_NAME  [name]
                     OUTPUT_DIR   [dir]
                     SHARED       [TRUE | FALSE]
                     OBJECT       [TRUE | FALSE]
                     CLEAR_PREFIX [TRUE | FALSE]
                     FOLDER       [name])

Adds a library target, called <libname>, to be built from the given sources.

This macro uses the BUILD_SHARED_LIBS, which is defaulted to OFF, to determine
whether the library will be build as shared or static. The optional boolean
SHARED argument can be used to override this choice.

The OBJECT argument creates a CMake object library. Basically it is a collection
of compiled source files that are not archived or linked. Unlike regular CMake
object libraries you do not have to use the $<TARGET_OBJECTS:<libname>> syntax,
you can just use <libname>.

Note: Object libraries do not follow CMake's transitivity rules until 3.12.
BLT will add the various information provided in this macro and its
dependencies in the order you provide them to help.

The INCLUDES argument allows you to define what include directories are
needed by any target that is dependent on this library.  These will
be inherited by CMake's target dependency rules.

The DEFINES argument allows you to add needed compiler definitions that are
needed by any target that is dependent on this library.  These will
be inherited by CMake's target dependency rules.

If given a DEPENDS_ON argument, it will add the necessary includes and 
libraries if they are already registered with blt_register_library.  If 
not it will add them as a CMake target dependency.

In addition, this macro will add the associated dependencies to the given
library target. Specifically, it will add the dependency for the CMake target
and for copying the headers for that target as well.

The OUTPUT_DIR is used to control the build output directory of this 
library. This is used to overwrite the default lib directory.
OUTPUT_NAME is the name of the output file; the default is NAME.

It's useful when multiple libraries with the same name need to be created
by different targets. NAME is the target name, OUTPUT_NAME is the library name.
CLEAR_PREFIX allows you to remove the automatically appended "lib" prefix
from your built library.  The created library will be foo.a instead of libfoo.a.
FOLDER is an optional keyword to organize the target into a folder in an IDE.

This is available when ENABLE_FOLDERS is ON and when the cmake generator
supports this feature and will otherwise be ignored. 

Note: Do not use with header-only (INTERFACE) libraries, as this will generate 
a CMake configuration error.


.. _blt_add_test:

blt_add_test
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: cmake

    blt_add_test( NAME           [name]
                  COMMAND        [command]
                  NUM_MPI_TASKS  [n]
                  CONFIGURATIONS [config1 [config2...]])

Adds a test to the project.

NAME
  Name that CTest reports.

COMMAND
  Command line that will be used to run the test and can include arguments.

NUM_MPI_TASKS
  Indicates this is an MPI test and how many MPI tasks to use.

CONFIGURATIONS
  Set the CTest configuration for this test.  When not specified, the test
  will be added to the default CTest configuration.

This macro adds the named test to CTest, which is run by the build target ``test``. This macro
does not build the executable and requires a prior call to :ref:`blt_add_executable`.

This macro assists with building up the correct command line. It will prepend
the RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY target property to the executable.

If NUM_MPI_TASKS is given or ENABLE_WRAP_ALL_TESTS_WITH_MPIEXEC is set, the macro 
will appropiately use MPIEXEC, MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG, and BLT_MPI_COMMAND_APPEND 
to create the MPI run line.

MPIEXEC and MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG are filled in by CMake's FindMPI.cmake but can
be overwritten in your host-config specific to your platform. BLT_MPI_COMMAND_APPEND
is useful on machines that require extra arguments to MPIEXEC.

.. note::
  If you do not require this macros command line assistance, you can call CMake's
  ``add_test()`` directly. For example, you may have a script checked into your
  repository you wish to run as a test instead of an executable you built as a part
  of your build system.

Any calls to this macro should be guarded with ENABLE_TESTS unless this option
is always on in your build project.

.. code-block:: cmake
    :caption: **Example**
    :linenos:

    if (ENABLE_TESTS)
        blt_add_executable(NAME    my_test
                           SOURCES my_test.cpp)
        blt_add_test(NAME    my_test
                     COMMAND my_test --with-some-argument)
    endif()


.. _blt_register_library:

blt_register_library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: cmake

    blt_register_library( NAME                     <libname>
                          DEPENDS_ON               [dep1 [dep2 ...]]
                          INCLUDES                 [include1 [include2 ...]]
                          TREAT_INCLUDES_AS_SYSTEM [ON|OFF]
                          FORTRAN_MODULES          [path1 [path2 ..]]
                          LIBRARIES                [lib1 [lib2 ...]]
                          COMPILE_FLAGS            [flag1 [flag2 ..]]
                          LINK_FLAGS               [flag1 [flag2 ..]]
                          DEFINES                  [def1 [def2 ...]] )

Registers a library to the project to ease use in other BLT macro calls.

Stores information about a library in a specific way that is easily recalled
in other macros.  For example, after registering gtest, you can add gtest to
the DEPENDS_ON in your blt_add_executable call and it will add the INCLUDES
and LIBRARIES to that executable.

TREAT_INCLUDES_AS_SYSTEM informs the compiler to treat this library's include paths
as system headers.  Only some compilers support this. This is useful if the headers
generate warnings you want to not have them reported in your build. This defaults
to OFF.

This does not actually build the library.  This is strictly to ease use after
discovering it on your system or building it yourself inside your project.

Note: The OBJECT parameter is for internal BLT support for object libraries
and is not for users.  Object libraries are created using blt_add_library().
