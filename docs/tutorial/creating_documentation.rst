Creating Documentation
======================

BLT provides macros to build documentation using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_
and `Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.org/>`_.


Sphinx is the documentation system used by the Python programming 
language project (among many others).

Doxygen is  a widely used system that generates documentation from annotated source code.
Doxygen is heavily used for documenting  C++ software.

Sphinx and Doxygen are not built into BLT, so the ``sphinx-build`` and ``doxygen`` executables
must be available via a user's ``PATH`` at configuration time, or explicitly specified using the
CMake variables ``SPHINX_EXECUTABLE`` and ``DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE``.


Here is an example of setting ``sphinx-build`` and ``doxygen`` paths in a host-config file:

.. code-block:: cmake
   
   set(SPHINX_EXECUTABLE "/usr/bin/sphinx-build" CACHE FILEPATH "")

   set(DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE "/usr/bin/doxygen" CACHE FILEPATH "")


The ``calc_pi`` example provides examples of both Sphinx and Doxygen documentation. 


Calc Pi Sphinx Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sphinx is a python package that depends on several other packages.  
It can be installed via `spack <https://spack.io>`_, pip, anaconda, etc... 

``sphinx-build`` processes a ``config.py`` file which includes a tree of `reStructuredText` files.
The Sphinx ``sphinx-quickstart`` utility helps you generate a new sphinx project, including
selecting common settings for the ``config.py``.


BLT provides a ``blt_add_sphinx_target()`` macro which, which will look for a ``conf.py`` file
in the current directory and add a command to build the Sphinx docs using this file to the ``docs``
CMake target.

.. admonition:: blt_add_sphinx_target
   :class: hint

   A macro to create a named sphinx target for user documentation.  
   Assumes there is a ``conf.py`` sphinx configuration file in the current directory.  
   This macro is active when BLT is configured with a valid ``SPHINX_EXECUTABLE`` path.


Here is an example of using ``blt_add_sphinx_target()`` in a CMakeLists.txt file:

.. literalinclude:: calc_pi/docs/sphinx/CMakeLists.txt
   :language: rst


Here is the example reStructuredText file that contains documentation for the *calc_pi* example.

.. literalinclude:: calc_pi/docs/sphinx/index.rst
   :language: rst
   

Calc Pi Doxygen Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doxygen is a compiled executable that can be installed via spack, built-by-hand, etc...

``doxygen`` processes a ``Doxyfile`` which specifies options, including where to look for
annotated source files.

BLT provides a ``blt_add_doxygen_target()`` macro which, which will look for a ``Doxyfile.in``
file in the current directory, configure this file to create a ``Doxyfile`` in the build directory,
and add a command to build the Doxygen docs using this file to the ``docs`` CMake target.

.. admonition:: blt_add_doxygen_target
   :class: hint

   A macro to create a named doxygen target for API documentation.  
   Assumes there is a ``Doxyfile.in`` doxygen configuration file in the current directory.  
   This macro is active when BLT is configured with a valid ``DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE`` path.


Here is an example of using ``blt_add_doxygen_target()`` in a CMakeLists.txt file:

.. literalinclude:: calc_pi/docs/doxygen/CMakeLists.txt
   :language: rst


Here is the example ``Doxyfile.in`` file that is configured by CMake and passed to ``doxygen``.

.. literalinclude:: calc_pi/docs/doxygen/Doxyfile.in
   :language: rst



Building the Calc Pi Example Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Here is an example of building both the calc_pi Sphinx and Doxygen docs using the ``docs`` CMake target:

.. code-block:: console

   cd build-calc-pi
   make docs
   ...
   [ 50%] Building HTML documentation with Sphinx
   [ 50%] Built target calc_pi_sphinx
   [ 50%] Built target sphinx_docs
   [100%] Generating API documentation with Doxygen
   Searching for include files...
   Searching for example files...
   Searching for images...
   Searching for dot files...
   ...
   lookup cache used 3/65536 hits=3 misses=3
   finished...
   [100%] Built target calc_pi_doxygen
   [100%] Built target doxygen_docs
   [100%] Built target docs




After this, you can view the Sphinx docs at:

* ``build-calc-pi/docs/sphinx/html/index.html``

and the Doxygen docs at:

* ``build-calc-pi/docs/doxygen/html/index.html``
