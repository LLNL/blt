Common HPC Dependencies
=======================

BLT creates named targets for the common HPC dependencies that most HPC projects need, such as
MPI, CUDA, HIP, and OpenMP.  Something BLT assists it's users with is getting these dependencies
to interoperate within the same library or executable.

As previously mentioned in :ref:`AddingTests`, BLT also provides 
bundled versions of GoogleTest, GoogleMock, GoogleBenchmark, and FRUIT.  Not only are the source
for these included, we provide named CMake targets for them as well.

BLT's ``blt::mpi``, ``blt::cuda``, ``blt::cuda_runtime``, ``blt::hip``, ``blt::hip_runtime``,
and ``blt::openmp`` targets are all defined via the :ref:`blt_import_library` macro.
This creates a true CMake imported target that is inherited properly through the CMake's
dependency graph.

.. note::
    BLT also supports exporting its third-party targets via the ``BLT_EXPORT_THIRDPARTY`` option.
    See :ref:`ExportingTargets` for more information.

You have already seen one use of ``DEPENDS_ON`` for a BLT dependency, ``gtest``, in ``test_1``:

.. literalinclude:: calc_pi/CMakeLists.txt 
   :start-after: _blt_tutorial_calcpi_test1_executable_start
   :end-before:  _blt_tutorial_calcpi_test1_executable_end
   :language: cmake

MPI
~~~

Our next example, ``test_2``, builds and tests the ``calc_pi_mpi`` library,
which uses MPI to parallelize the calculation over the integration intervals.

To enable MPI, we set ``ENABLE_MPI``, ``MPI_C_COMPILER``, and ``MPI_CXX_COMPILER``
in our host config file. Here is a snippet with these settings for LLNL's Lassen Cluster:

.. literalinclude:: ../../host-configs/llnl/toss_4_x86_64_ib/gcc@10.3.1.cmake
   :start-after: _blt_tutorial_mpi_config_start
   :end-before:  _blt_tutorial_mpi_config_end
   :language: cmake


Here, you can see how ``calc_pi_mpi`` and ``test_2`` use ``DEPENDS_ON``:

.. literalinclude:: calc_pi/CMakeLists.txt 
   :start-after: _blt_tutorial_calcpi_test2_executable_start
   :end-before:  _blt_tutorial_calcpi_test2_executable_end
   :language: cmake


For MPI unit tests, you also need to specify the number of MPI Tasks
to launch. We use the ``NUM_MPI_TASKS`` argument to :ref:`blt_add_test` macro.

.. literalinclude:: calc_pi/CMakeLists.txt 
   :start-after: _blt_tutorial_calcpi_test2_test_start
   :end-before:  _blt_tutorial_calcpi_test2_test_end
   :language: cmake


As mentioned in :ref:`AddingTests`, GoogleTest provides a default ``main()``
driver that will execute all unit tests defined in the source. To test MPI code,
we need to create a main that initializes and finalizes MPI in addition to Google
Test. ``test_2.cpp`` provides an example driver for MPI with GoogleTest.

.. literalinclude:: calc_pi/test_2.cpp
   :start-after: _blt_tutorial_calcpi_test2_main_start
   :end-before:  _blt_tutorial_calcpi_test2_main_end
   :language: cpp

.. note::
  While we have tried to ensure that BLT chooses the correct setup information
  for MPI, there are several niche cases where the default behavior is
  insufficient. We have provided several available override variables:
  
  * ``BLT_MPI_COMPILE_FLAGS``
  * ``BLT_MPI_INCLUDES``
  * ``BLT_MPI_LIBRARIES``
  * ``BLT_MPI_LINK_FLAGS``
  
  BLT also has the variable ``ENABLE_FIND_MPI`` which turns off all CMake's ``FindMPI``
  logic and then uses the MPI wrapper directly when you provide them as the default
  compilers.


CUDA
~~~~

Finally, ``test_3`` builds and tests the ``calc_pi_cuda`` library,
which uses CUDA to parallelize the calculation over the integration intervals.

To enable CUDA, we set ``ENABLE_CUDA``, ``CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER``, 
``CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES``, and ``CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR`` in our host config file.
Also before enabling the CUDA language in CMake, you need to set 
``CMAKE_CUDA_HOST_COMPILER`` in CMake 3.9+ or ``CUDA_HOST_COMPILER`` in previous versions.
If you do not call ``enable_language(CUDA)``, BLT will set the appropriate host
compiler variable for you and enable the CUDA language.

.. note::
   The ``BLT_CXX_STD`` variable is useful to set the C++ and CUDA language standard to the
   same level. For example, ``c++17`` will set a both to C++17.

Here is a snippet with these settings for LLNL's Lassen Cluster:

.. literalinclude:: ../../host-configs/llnl/blueos_3_ppc64le_ib_p9/clang@10.0.1_nvcc_c++17.cmake
   :start-after: _blt_tutorial_cuda_config_start
   :end-before:  _blt_tutorial_cuda_config_end
   :language: cmake

Here, you can see how ``calc_pi_cuda`` and ``test_3`` use ``DEPENDS_ON``:

.. literalinclude:: calc_pi/CMakeLists.txt 
   :start-after: _blt_tutorial_calcpi_cuda_start
   :end-before:  _blt_tutorial_calcpi_cuda_end
   :language: cmake

The ``blt::cuda`` dependency for ``calc_pi_cuda`` is a little special, 
along with adding the normal CUDA library and headers to your library or executable,
it also tells BLT that this target's C/C++/CUDA source files need to be compiled via
``nvcc`` or ``cuda-clang``. If this is not a requirement, you can use the dependency
``blt::cuda_runtime`` which also adds the CUDA runtime library and headers but will not
compile each source file with ``nvcc``.

Some other useful CUDA variables are:

.. literalinclude:: ../../host-configs/llnl/blueos_3_ppc64le_ib_p9/clang@10.0.1_nvcc_c++14_xlf.cmake
   :start-after: _blt_tutorial_useful_cuda_variables_start
   :end-before:  _blt_tutorial_useful_cuda_variables_end
   :language: cmake


OpenMP
~~~~~~

To enable OpenMP, set ``ENABLE_OPENMP`` in your host-config file or before loading
``SetupBLT.cmake``.  Once OpenMP is enabled, simply add ``blt::openmp`` to your library
executable's ``DEPENDS_ON`` list.

Here is an example of how to add an OpenMP enabled executable:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/smoke/CMakeLists.txt
   :start-after: _blt_tutorial_openmp_executable_start
   :end-before:  _blt_tutorial_openmp_executable_end
   :language: cmake

Here is an example of how to add an OpenMP enabled test that sets the amount of threads used:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/smoke/CMakeLists.txt
   :start-after: _blt_tutorial_openmp_test_start
   :end-before:  _blt_tutorial_openmp_test_end
   :language: cmake


HIP
~~~

BLT's AMD HIP support is very similar to it's CUDA support with one caveat. Our HIP support was
implemented before CMake had full HIP language support and therefore requires that the HIP
compilers be set as the main compilers. This will change soon.

**Important Setup Variables**

* ``ENABLE_HIP`` : Enables HIP support in BLT
* ``HIP_ROOT_DIR`` : Root directory for HIP installation
* ``CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES`` : GPU architecture to use when generating HIP/ROCm code

**BLT Targets**

* ``blt::hip`` : Adds include directories, hip runtime libraries, and compiles source with hipcc
* ``blt::hip_runtime`` : Adds include directories and hip runtime libraries

.. note::
   The ``BLT_CXX_STD`` variable is useful to set the C++ and HIP language standard to the
   same level. For example, ``c++17`` will set a both to C++17.

The following two code snippets show an example of a basic host-config with HIP enabled for the
`toss_4_x86_64_ib_cray` platform:

.. literalinclude:: ../../host-configs/llnl/toss_4_x86_64_ib_cray/clang@16.0.0_hip.cmake
   :start-after: _blt_tutorial_hip_compiler_start
   :end-before:  _blt_tutorial_hip_compiler_end
   :language: cmake


.. literalinclude:: ../../host-configs/llnl/toss_4_x86_64_ib_cray/clang@16.0.0_hip.cmake
   :start-after: _blt_tutorial_useful_hip_variables_start
   :end-before:  _blt_tutorial_useful_hip_variables_end
   :language: cmake

Here is an example of using the BLT HIP target to create an executable:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/smoke/CMakeLists.txt
   :start-after: _blt_tutorial_hip_executable_start
   :end-before:  _blt_tutorial_hip_executable_end
   :language: cmake
