Creating Libraries and Executables
==================================

In the previous section, we learned the basics about how to create a CMake project with BLT, 
how to configure the project and how to build and test BLT's built-in third party libraries.  

We now move on to creating libraries and executables
using two of BLT's core macros: ``blt_add_library`` and ``blt_add_executable``.

We begin with a simple executable that calculates pi by numerical integration (``example_1``).  
We will then extract that code into a library, which we link into a new executable (``example_2``).


Example 1: Basic executable
---------------------------

This example is as basic as it gets. After setting up a BLT CMake project, 
like ``blank_project`` in the previous section, we can start using BLT's macros.  
Creating an executable is as simple as calling the following macro:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/calc_pi/CMakeLists.txt
   :language: cmake
   :lines: 28-29

This tells CMake to create an executable named ``example_1`` with one source file (``example_1.cpp``).

You can create this project yourself or you can run the already provided ``tutorial/calc_pi`` project.
For ease of use, we have combined many examples into this one CMake project.  After running
the following commands, you will create the executable ``<build dir>/bin/example_1``:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd <BLT repository/docs/tutorial/calc_pi
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DBLT_SOURCE_DIR=../../.. ..
    make

.. admonition:: blt_add_executable
   :class: hint
   
   This is one of the core macros that enables BLT to simplify our CMake-based project.
   It unifies many CMake calls into one easy to use macro.  
   ``blt_add_executable`` creates a CMake executable target with the 
   given sources, sets the output directory to ``<build dir>/bin`` (unless overridden with the
   macro parameter ``OUTPUT_DIR``) and handles internal and external dependencies in a greatly
   simplified manner.  There will be more on that in the following section.


Example 2: One library, one executable
--------------------------------------

This example is a bit more exciting.  This time we are creating a library that calculates
pi and then linking that library into an executable.

First, we create the library with the following BLT code:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/calc_pi/CMakeLists.txt
   :language: cmake
   :lines: 34-36

Just like before, this creates a CMake library target that will get built to ``<build dir>/lib/libcalc_pi.a``.

Next, we create an executable named ``example_2`` and link in the previously created library target:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/calc_pi/CMakeLists.txt
   :language: cmake
   :lines: 39-41

The ``DEPENDS_ON`` parameter properly links the previously defined library into this executable without any
more work or CMake function calls.


.. admonition:: blt_add_library
   :class: hint

   This is another core BLT macro.  It creates a CMake library target and associates the
   given sources and headers along with handling dependencies the same way as ``blt_add_executable``
   does.  It also provides a few commonly used build options, such as overriding the output name of the
   library and the output directory.  It defaults to building a static library unless you override it with
   ``SHARED`` or with the global CMake option ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS``.

Object Libraries
----------------

BLT has simplified the use of CMake object libraries through the ``blt_add_library`` macro.
Object libraries are a collection of object files that are not linked or archived into
a library.  They are used in other libraries or executables through the ``DEPENDS_ON``
argument.  This is generally useful for combining smaller libraries into a larger library
without the linker removing unused symbols in the larger library.

.. code-block:: cmake

    blt_add_library(NAME    myObjectLibrary
                    SOURCES source1.cpp
                    HEADERS header1.cpp
                    OBJECT  TRUE)

    blt_add_exectuble(NAME       helloWorld
                      SOURCES    main.cpp
                      DEPENDS_ON myObjectLibrary)
